# peer-2-peer-network-simulation

I collaborated with my dear colleague [Yusuf](https://github.com/ynsengun) for this simulation.

The program simulates a p2p network. There is a tophology graph that describes how clients are connected to each other. Once a client connects to a server (which is also a client), the server starts sending information, simulating a distributed p2p network.

## My Contributions

We pair-programmed the entire project with [Yusuf](https://github.com/ynsengun). Most of the time, he was coding while I was **back-seat coding**.
